        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Compared to other curries, Japanese curry is much thicker, which I personally love. Compared to Indian curry, it has a much milder flavor, which some may prefer (I love both types of curry though and I believe there is a time and place for both of them). This is one of the most eaten dishes in Japan, both at restaurants and home. Although not traditional, it is nevertheless an important staple in modern Japanese cuisine.</p>

        <p>There are many different types of Japanese curry made both at home and in restaurants around the country, including tonkatsu curry. This particular recipe uses beef, carrots, onions, and potatoes since I like these a lot. Even though Japanese curry is commonly made at home, they don't make it from scratch with all of the spices. In other words, they don't gather all of the spices, grind them, and make their own roux. Instead, they use an instant curry block. These usually come in three spice levels: mild, medium, and hot. Although they are labeled as such, the hot curry block isn't really that hot and most people should be able to handle it. I prefer using the hot one, but you are free to use whichever one you prefer.</p>

        <p>Although this recipe uses a curry block, there are <em>plenty</em> of ways to make this recipe your own. I personally create something I like to call an umami bomb. Despite it's name, it's packed with both umami and sweetness. Additionally, I like to add a Moroccan hot sauce (I will add a link here if/when I find one) that goes very well with the flavor. I find that this and the umami bomb add a lot more depth and flavor compared to just using the instant curry. With all of that said, you should experiment and make this your own recipe by adding your own additions.</p>
