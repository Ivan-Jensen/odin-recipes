        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Compared to other curries, Japanese curry is much thicker, which I personally love. Compared to Indian curry, it has a much milder flavor, which some may prefer (I love both types of curry though and I believe there is a time and place for both of them). This is one of the most eaten dishes in Japan, both at restaurants and home. Although not traditional, it is nevertheless an important staple in modern Japanese cuisine.</p>

        <p>There are many different types of Japanese curry made both at home and in restaurants around the country, including tonkatsu curry. This particular recipe uses beef, carrots, onions, and potatoes since I like these a lot. Even though Japanese curry is commonly made at home, they don't make it from scratch with all of the spices. In other words, they don't gather all of the spices, grind them, and make their own roux. Instead, they use an instant curry block. These usually come in three spice levels: mild, medium, and hot. Although they are labeled as such, the hot curry block isn't really that hot and most people should be able to handle it. I prefer using the hot one, but you are free to use whichever one you prefer.</p>

        <p>Although this recipe uses a curry block, there are <em>plenty</em> of ways to make this recipe your own. I personally create something I like to call an umami bomb. Despite it's name, it's packed with both umami and sweetness. Additionally, I like to add a Moroccan hot sauce (I will add a link here if/when I find one) that goes very well with the flavor. I find that this and the umami bomb add a lot more depth and flavor compared to just using the instant curry. With all of that said, you should experiment and make this your own recipe by adding your own additions.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb <strong>chuck roast</strong> (or other type of beef good for stew)</li>
            <li>2 medium <strong>sweet onions</strong></li>
            <li>2 <strong>carrots</strong></li>
            <li>3 <strong>yukon gold potatoes</strong></li>
            <li>1 Tbsp <strong>vegetable oil</strong> (or any neutral oil with a high smoke point)</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups of <strong>unsalted chicken stock</strong> (or see package for instructions)</li>
            <li>1 package of <strong>Japanese curry mix</strong> (any brand that you prefer)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Cut vegetables into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>Without cutting, pat chuck roast dry with a paper towel</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pot (I like using a Dutch oven but not everyone has one) on medium-high</li>
            <li>Brown each side of the chuck roast in the pot (don't cook it though, we just want to brown it)</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down to medium and add onions to the same pot. Cook for 8 minutes</li>
            <li>While the onions are cooking, cut the chuck roast into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>Once the 8 minutes are up, add the rest of your veggies and cooked meat</li>
            <li>Add chicken stock to the pot until it barely covers the top of the ingredients in the pot</li>
            <li>Let the chicken stock come up to a boil</li>
            <li>Once it starts boiling, skim any fat off the top and reduce the heat to low</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for 45 minutes or until the meat becomes tender. If using a pressure cooker, only cook for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove curry from heat and add curry block. Break the pieces apart and immediately stir so that the block properly mixes and becomes dissolved</li>
            <li>If you're using an umami-bomb (I will provide the ingredients to my recipe later), then add it now, along with the Moroccan hot sauce and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes (simmer longer if you prefer it thicker)</li>
            <li>Pour the curry over rice or eat it as is!</li>
        </ol>
