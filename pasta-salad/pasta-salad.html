        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>What makes this particular recipe of pasta salad stand out from other ones I've had is the inclusion of feta cheese, balsamic vinegar, and fresh basil. This is a dish my mom made a lot for my siblings and me as a kid. Even as adults, we still crave it, and my mom will make it whenever we all visit her. It's the perfect spring and summer dish since it's refreshing and cold. Furthermore, it's perfect for leftovers since the dish is meant to be served cold. During college, I loved making this dish at the beginning of the week and portioning it into deli containers so that I could eat it for lunch for the rest of the week. It's simply that delicious!</p>

        <p>This particular recipe uses chicken breast, but feel free to exclude it if you're vegetarian or don't feel like eating chicken. Additionally, my mom often included black olives on the side for people to add, but I absolutely <em>DESPISE</em> them (as well as all olives). However, if you enjoy black olives (for some sick reason), then feel free to include them.</p>

        <p>People often ask what the point of seasoning pasta water is or if it makes a difference. It absolutely does. If you don't taste the difference then it's probably because you didn't add enough salt. Some people to say to salt your water like the ocean. Don't do that. The ocean's water is about 3.5% salt, which is far too salty. Instead, aim to add about 2% salt by volume. The water should taste like a well-seasoned dish. If you want this dish (or any other dish for that matter), to taste delicious, then it is of the utmost importance to season every component of the dish along every step. If, for example, instead of adding salt to your pasta water, you took the salt you would add into the pasta water and added all of the salt to the sauce (plus the salt you would normally add to the sauce), then you'd end up with a super salty sauce and bland pasta. You don't want that. Thus, it's best to season everything until it tastes delicious to you.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb dried pasta in a shape good for pasta salad (since the dish has a sauce, I like using a shape that lots of nooks and crannies that can hold the sauce. I personally use penne, but use whatever you like.) </li>

            <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>

            <li>1 clam shell of fresh basil</li>
            <li>5-6 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
