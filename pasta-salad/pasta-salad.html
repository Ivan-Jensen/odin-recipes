        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>What makes this particular recipe of pasta salad stand out from other ones I've had is the inclusion of feta cheese, balsamic vinegar, and fresh basil. This is a dish my mom made a lot for my siblings and me as a kid. Even as adults, we still crave it, and my mom will make it whenever we all visit her. It's the perfect spring and summer dish since it's refreshing and cold. Furthermore, it's perfect for leftovers since the dish is meant to be served cold. During college, I loved making this dish at the beginning of the week and portioning it into deli containers so that I could eat it for lunch for the rest of the week. It's simply that delicious!</p>

        <p>This particular recipe uses chicken breast, but feel free to exclude it if you're vegetarian or don't feel like eating chicken. Additionally, my mom often included black olives on the side for people to add, but I absolutely <em>DESPISE</em> them (as well as all olives). However, if you enjoy black olives (for some sick reason), then feel free to include them.</p>

        <p>People often ask what the point of seasoning pasta water is or if it makes a difference. It absolutely does. If you don't taste the difference then it's probably because you didn't add enough salt. Some people to say to salt your water like the ocean. Don't do that. The ocean's water is about 3.5% salt, which is far too salty. Instead, aim to add about 2% salt by volume. The water should taste like a well-seasoned dish. If you want this dish (or any other dish for that matter), to taste delicious, then it is of the utmost importance to season every component of the dish along every step. If, for example, instead of adding salt to your pasta water, you took the salt you would add into the pasta water and added all of the salt to the sauce (plus the salt you would normally add to the sauce), then you'd end up with a super salty sauce and bland pasta. You don't want that. Thus, it's best to season everything until it tastes delicious to you.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb dried pasta in a shape good for pasta salad (since the dish has a sauce, I like using a shape that lots of nooks and crannies that can hold the sauce. I personally use penne, but use whatever you like.) </li>
            <li>1 block of feta (about 6-8 ounces)</li>
            <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 small red onion sliced very thinly</li>
            <li>1 clam shell of fresh basil</li>
            <li>5-6 peeled cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Any herbs for chicken</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat chicken dry, add olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and herbs. Bake at 350 F until done (about 30-40 minutes). Pull out of oven as soon as chicken reaches internal temperature of 165 F to ensure it doesn't dry out. Once cooled enough, slice into strips or chunks and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta and peeled garlic cloves in pot of salted water to al dente (read package instructions). As mentioned in the description, add about 2% salt by volume to your water. You can add it before or after it boils, but I add it before so that I don't forget. Once pasta is al dente, strain and put pasta into large bowl. </li>
            <li>Working very carefully, pull out all boiled garlic cloves from pasta and place in blender with fresh basil and a few tablespoons of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Blend, then scrape down the sides of blender. Add more olive oil, about 3 tablespoons, salt, and pepper, and blend.</li>
            <li>Add about 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar to blender. Blend and taste. Add more olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and pepper until the taste and consistency is where you want it. It should be a sauce-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Pour basil sauce over pasta and stir. Crumble in feta, add chicken, and stir. Top with sliced red onion and serve.</li>
        </ol>
