        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Sinangag, or Filipino fried garlic rice, is simply a type of fried rice dish cooked with lots of garlic and salt to taste. It is traditionally eaten with various meals throughout the day. For example, during breakfast, it's typically served with other Filipino breakfast items such as tocino, longanisa, and a fried egg. Although this dish tastes amazing on its own, it's often best eaten with other dishes. I personally love eating it with tocino since it does a great job of balancing the fattiness and sweetness of the tocino. Although this recipe isn't for tocino, I want to mention that Filipino tocino is one of my favorite foods and that you should definitely try it if you haven't already.</p>

        <p>Like with all fried rice dishes, you want to use leftover rice from the fridge. This is so that the grains are properly separated and don't clump together while cooking. If you don't have any leftover rice, then using fresh rice is also fine as long as you properly dry it and separate the grains. The best way I've found to store leftover rice is to spread it out on a baking sheet, cover said it in plastic wrap, and store that in the fridge</p>

        <p>In terms of cooking this dish, it's best to use a carbon steel wok with a flat bottom. A wok has different heat zones which allow you to push ingredients already in the wok to the side so that you can cook new ones without overcooking the ones already in the pan. If you don't have a wok, then it is okay to use a heavy nonstick or nonstick skillet, but using a wok is the best option, and if you cook a lot of Asian cuisine, then I highly recommend purchasing one if you don't already have one.</p>
